# Factorial (Easy)

_This page is about how to solve factorial using recursive and iterative approaches._

#### Refer the [factorial problem explanation here](http://localhost:3000/docs/recursion/concept/what-is-recursion#factorial-of-a-number). This covers the following:

- Solving Factorial iteratively vs recursively
- Recursive tree of factorial
- Time and Space complexity of factorial
